Hi, I'm a programmer living in South Korea. I've been working on cloud infrastructure, web stuff.
I enjoy building things from the ground.   

This site is basically a public version of my zettelkasten.
I will upload some personal logs and things I find interesting. I'm not a good writer but hope you enjoy it.

If you have any questions, please send me an email. [acadx0@gmail.com](mailto:acadx0@gmail.com)
