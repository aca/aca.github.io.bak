Recently, I'm trying to add new scripting language called
[Raku](https://www.raku.org/), formerly known as Perl 6, to my daily workflow.
I have never used Perl before and I'm
having hard time with the syntax yet. But Raku's
[grammar](https://docs.raku.org/language/grammar_tutorial) is just so amazing that it really made lot of things extremely simple.

Here's example from [official raku website](https://www.raku.org/).
```
grammar Parser {
    rule  TOP  { I <love> <lang> }
    token love { '♥' | love }
    token lang { < Raku Perl Rust Go Python Ruby > }
}

say Parser.parse: 'I ♥ Raku';
# OUTPUT: ｢I ♥ Raku｣ love => ｢♥｣ lang => ｢Raku｣

say Parser.parse: 'I love Perl';
# OUTPUT: ｢I love Perl｣ love => ｢love｣ lang => ｢Perl｣
```

This is just amazing! Here's how I started using it. 

While I was writing some language server, I had to debug my server with nvim-lsp log which looks like this.

Log level, time, context information which was not necessary took half of my terminal screen and just made it harder to inspect the log.
I wanted to see the "messages" only. So I had to do some string manipulation. Instead of using regular expressions or awk, I wrote a proper working "parser" for the log just in a minute.
```
grammar log {
    rule  TOP  { '[' <level> ']' <time> ']' <file> ']' <msg> }
    token level  { \S+ }
    token time  { \S+ }
    token file  { \S+ }
    token msg  { .* }
}

for lines() {
  if $_ ne "" {
    my $m = log.parse($_);
    say "---";
    say "$m<msg>";
  }
}

```

And made the log simple just like this

With proper parser, I can now restructure the log anyway I want in a extremely simple manner.

We always have to write parser for almost every problem. I hope to see this features get adopted to other modern language.
